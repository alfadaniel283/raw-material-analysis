# Project Title: raw-material-analysis

## 🎯 Business Problem
1. uncontrolled material usage
2. poor forecasting
3. inventory shortage or overstocking
4. lack of data for decision making

## 🛠️ Tools & Tech
- **Excel:** data cleaning and Dashboard

## 📊 Key Insights
**Identification of High-Consumption Materials** – Certain raw materials show significantly higher total usage, indicating they are critical to production and require priority in procurement planning.
**Average Monthly Usage Pattern** – The average consumption figures provide a clear estimate of typical monthly demand, useful for forecasting and setting reorder levels.
**Material Demand Stability or Variability** – Comparing monthly figures reveals whether consumption is stable or fluctuating, helping detect irregular usage trends.
**Inventory Planning Needs** – Materials with consistently high averages require tighter inventory control to prevent stock-outs.
**Budget Impact Areas** – High-usage materials likely contribute more to production costs and should be closely monitored for cost efficiency.
**Procurement Optimization Opportunities** – Frequently used materials may benefit from bulk purchasing or long-term supplier agreements.
**Low-Usage Materials Identification** - Some materials show minimal consumption, suggesting possible overstocking or infrequent production use.
